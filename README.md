## How to Play

2. The game starts with "X" as the first player.
3. Click on an empty box to place your symbol (either "X" or "O").
4. The game will automatically switch to the other player after each move.
5. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all the boxes are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
7. You can start a new game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button.
